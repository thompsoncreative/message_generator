# Message Generator
Tony Thompson, developer

## Description
This program will generate a random message every time the program runs. The program will take a base sentence and swap out the nouns, verbs, and adjectives to generate a new, random, and possibly silly sentence.

### Example
Base sentence: A fuzzy bear bounded towards the stream to eat a fish.

Random message: A sly cat creeped towards the table to swat the glass.

Random message: A picky dog crawled towards the truck to eat the water.

## Objectives
- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer
